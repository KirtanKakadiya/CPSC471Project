# Overview of the Application
As a current university student finding quiet workspaces is quite difficult to find as many rooms get booked very quickly due to the large number of students at the university and only some rooms being available. The problem that we want to address is to create a web application where students will be able to access various types of rooms such as study rooms, lecture halls, and other workspaces that aren't being used. The solution that we have is to create an app similar to a standard web booking room however, offering access to more rooms such as lecture halls which can be used as a quiet study space for multiple students or regular study rooms. The reason that we chose to address this problem was because as current university students finding a quiet study space can be quite hard and only a limited number of rooms are available for booking. In some cases these rooms have a capacity of more than 4 people however only one person may be using the room. In the next couple of sections, we will be going more in depth about the problem definition and how we will approach how we will solve the problem and also the reasoning behind why we chose this problem.
